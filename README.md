This program is intended to utilize the PhotoPrism **docker** admin settings without needing to get a subscription. I don't pretend this is any better than a subscription but the intention is to help make it easier to manage your users in this app. 
Choose the settings and hit output and it will give you the command to run it. Copy that command into your server and it should work.

In the future, there will be an option to make the command run on your docker container for photoprism but right now it only outputs the command. Included in the repo is a very simplified version of this app that does run the command but you need to actually have the app running on that server to use it, otherwise you will get an error.
